    t "Thomas, 15."

    "The boy stands up and comes to my desk to receive his corrected paper, seemingly satisfied."

    t "Héloïse, 13."

    "The girl tries hard to hide her pout as she takes the essay, but I can see through. I know she's used to better. It's a pity, but her depiction of Russia's stance on decolonisation was more than inaccurate."

    t "Ismail, 16."

    "The procession continues for half a minute."

    t "Đạt, 17."

    "17 out of 20 is an excellent grade, but instead of a smile, the pupil lets out a sigh."

    t "Jordan, 19."

    "Jordan, with his usual joyful gait, comes to receive his trophy. He walks back to his seat under the congratulations—in teen slang—of his comrades."

    "I finish giving the papers back and address the class:"

    t "That's it. I'll give you some time to check your answers once more. Tell me if you have any questions."

    ### %% we hear boy crumpling paper %%
    # SFX: crumpling paper
    "I sort my notes to prepare the incoming lesson, when the sound of crumbled paper catches my attention."

    "I see Đạt clutching a paper ball, even more serious than before."

    # SFX: crumpling paper
    "I expect him to throw the ball into the bin, but instead, he unwraps it and flattens it down on his desk—revealing his wrinkled essay."

    ## %% Other pupils around murmur and complain about his behaviour, but the boy ignores them: 40 %%

    ## %% New teacher approaches boy who can do nothing but be annoyed, and starts discussing: 30 %%
    "I'd better have a look to find out what's wrong."

    "I walk to his desk."

    ## %% They talk about the optimistic and pessimistic view on grades: 80 %%

label .good_job:

    t "Good job! The part on the Third World's non-alignment with the United States and the USSR was well constructed."

    "He flips the pages to focus on other parts of the test, revealing a few other points I had marked in red while correcting the paper."

    t "Yes, the dates were not really accurate, but what matters is that you got the big picture."

    ### %% Pupil says then why the minus / that 17 is 3 points away from 20. Three stupid mistakes. Being the first in the class would make it acceptable, but it's not even the case. %%
    "The boy frowns."

    b "It's not just the dates, I also got the events wrong. It was obvious."

    t "Maybe, but the rest was correct, enough to be worth 17 points in my grading."

    b "To me, it's just 3 points missing. And I could have avoided that. The other pupils prove it."

    # => unlock rivalry talk
    ## %% They talk about alternative ways to score and deliver score to pupils (self-correction, no grade, no public grade announcement…): 120 %%
    ### %% Maybe ABC would be better than numeric score? %%
label alternative_grading:

    t "Maybe the 20-point grading system makes you feel that way because it's so precise? What if I were using some A-B-C-D grading?"

    b "… Well, it'd probably feel like covering my mistakes, but at least I'd have the satisfaction of being top-ranked, even with a few mistakes—assuming I get A. Wouldn't 17 be more like a B though?"

    t "Hm… I suppose so. But more likely a B+!"

    b "…"

    ### %% They talk about how the broad skill matters more than the details. After all, this is how it looks like in a pro environment, where there are no grades %%
    t "Anyway, my point is, you have to focus on the big picture: the test ensures that you have a broad understanding of the topic."

    t "Then, if you couldn't answer some questions, that's something you can dig deeper into."

    b "But I already see what was wrong, and I have nothing more to learn."

    t "Then that's great too. Most students here don't understand what is missing, and have difficulties fixing their shortcomings. Being able to understand one's mistakes quickly is a strength."

    b "…"

    t "And sometimes, even then, it's worth digging deeper: the test, after all, can be passed by tackling the surface of each topic, but real history is much deeper."

    t "The more you understand a topic in depth, the less likely you're to make small mistakes."

    t "This is what professionals and experts do: they study beyond what's asked from them."

    t "Academics don't undergo tests like these. Instead, they focus on researching further, writing papers or delivering talks."

    t "And office employees don't have grades either, only their overall performance matters."

    b "Hm. Sounds nice."

    ### %% T: maybe not announce grades publicly? %%
label private_grades:

    t "What about not announcing grades publicly, so you don't compare yourself to others?"

    b "I see, that would allow me to focus on my own work… Although it would feel like hiding the truth to make me feel better."

    t "You're hard on yourself!"

    ## %% They talk about working hard to survive vs chill work in a room, battlefield vs playground, education and tests vs actual work to produce something: 150 %%
    ### %% T: Why this elitism? %%
label elitism:

    t "Why do you think you need to be that much successful everywhere?"

    b "Not everywhere. Where I already know I'm not totally bad."

    t "Are your parents pushing that far?"

    b "No, I just don't like failing. Although my father appreciates it when I get good grades."

    t "I'm guessing from your name that he comes from Viêtnam?"

    b "Yes, why?"

    t "As a migrant, he may make a point of ensuring you are successful in academics in order to be both well integrated in society and make a lot of money. I am one myself so I know that feeling."

    t "But your generation lives in peace and is already well integrated. You don't need to strain yourself like this."

    b "…"

    b "But I want to deserve my parents' wealth. If I don't work in an office, studying is the second best thing I can do."

    t "I see. But in offices, employees have no grades, their overall performance and teamwork matters more."

    # TODO: combine with similar professional talk above
    ## %% They talk about self-satisfaction and using true skills to actually produce something in life and how finding this extra-curricular activity until having an actual job matters: 80 %%
    ### %% T: what do you wanna do in life? %%
label why_study:

    t "Why are you studying?"

    "Đạt raises an eyebrow."

    b "Well, that's what school is for. We study so we become better, we can pass exams and prove that we're worth it and go on in life."

    t "No, I mean, what do you want to do in life with everything you would have learned here?"

    "The boy ponders."

    b "No clue. I suppose I could get a job in human sciences or something, but I'm not interested in research that much."

    t "Then that's one thing you can think about that may considerably shift your values."

    t "If you do end up in human sciences, that knowledge will be much more important to you that it will be for another student, even if they had a better grade."

    b "Isn't that precisely a good reason to be the best?"

    t "Maybe. But more importantly, you'll practice every day and so your 17 will be a solid 17. While you can get a 19 by revising a lot before the test, and forget it later."

    "Đạt glanced at Jordan."

    b "Hm. I don't think you can score that much just with last time revisions, but I get your point."

    t "Even without becoming a professional, this knowledge is worth what it is. Maybe you can talk with your parents about Southeast Asia's decolonisation."

    b "I see…"

    ## %% They talk about rivalry and other classmates doing better, or worse, and their own circumstances, serious training and pressure: 120 %%
label lucky:

    t "You know, not everyone can get grades that good, you should consider yourself lucky."

    b "Maybe I'm lucky to have potential, but I still need to work. Besides, people who don't get good grades get used to mediocrity and stop caring."

    b "People who do must raise the bar and are just as likely to miss it. I don't see how that makes me luckier."

    ### %% T: every human has circumstances %%
    t "Every human has circumstances, some may fare better or worse depending on their context and mental state."

    b "But I didn't have particular issues for this exam, nor in general in life. So I have no excuses."

    ### %% T: and training %%
    t "Maybe Jordan just trained a lot."

    b "I also do! I do all the homework."

    t "Maybe you can do more?"

    b "I suppose so… but if Jordan can get 19 without extra work, why should I? Sounds unfair to me."

    "I look around the classroom."

    t "Maybe that's also what other pupils think about you."

    b "Oh, the sandwich effect."

    pause 0.5

    t "The… sandwich?"

    b "Yes, when you rank second, you're annoyed because you couldn't beat the first. {b}And{/b} the third one and everyone else below complain about you because you beat them but still complain."

    b "So you get sandwiched between them and take double penalty."

    t "Right, I understand…"

    t "Anyway, nothing says that Jordan is not putting extra work anywhere. If not in history, it could be in mathematics or sports."

    t "So there's no shame in doing some extra, especially on something that matters to you."

    b "Fine, I will consider."

    b "In the meantime, Jordan doesn't pressured or anything. He always goes to parties."

    t "You don't seem stressed outside exam results either, casually talking to your friends."

    t "Maybe he parties precisely to evacuate that stress?"

    ### %% They talk about showing satisfaction %%
label facial_expression:

    t "I noticed you didn't smile but let out a sigh. Was it out of spite?"

    b "No, out of relief. I was worried I might have messed up this test."

    t "Then why the sudden change of mind?"

    b "Because Jordan did better."

    #### %% Why no smile? %%
    t "You can be proud of yourself and smile about your success."

    b "No, that would be boasting. Or worse, if something else got a better grade right after me, I'll look stupid. Which happened, so I'm glad I didn't smile."

    ## %% The conversation ends, the teacher understanding better and pupil considering the teacher’s words: 50 %%
    t "So, you think you can be satisfied with what you did?"

    b "I don't know. At least I know what I did wrong. For the rest, I can't guarantee."

    pause 1.0

    ## %% Epilogue: 50 %%
    ### %% the boy is now is high school working on some personal project (what they said they liked answering T question) %%
    "Epilogue - 7 years later"

    "In my living room, at the end of the documentary, I recognise a name in the credits."

    "I check on LinkedIn that it's not a homonym, but it is him."

    "It looks like Đạt is investigating cross-continental migrations and tracing the stories of families who left it all in search of a better life, without war nor totalitarianism."

    "He's probably happier now, without grades and just the satisfaction of making something meaningful for the society."

    "Oh, the film is scored 85\% on Rotten Tomatoes."
